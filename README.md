## Overview

### The challenge
- Build a Tribute Page. You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. 
- I decided to create a tribute page for the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI)

#### User Stories (Minimum tasks to be completed)
1. My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
2. I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
3. I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".
4. Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".
5. Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.
6. I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
7. I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").
8. The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
9. The img element should be centered within its parent element.
